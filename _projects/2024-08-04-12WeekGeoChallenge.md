Inspired by the **30DayMapChallenge**, friends and I created our own **12WeekGeoChallenge**, where we have one week to create a map on a specific topic. I mostly used ArcGIS Pro, as well as the Affinity suit for drawing and creating own symbols etc.

Topics of the challenge:
* River Networks/Waterbodies
* Polar Regions
* Animals in the wild
* Elevation Map
* Local Landmarks
* Natural Disasters/Human Impact
* Minimalist Map
* Unexpected Map
* Creative Lines
* Air Quality
* Travel/Adventure Route
* Raster Creativity 

## Topic 01: river networks/water bodies üó∫Ô∏è Map of the Amazon Basin

  <figcaption>Map of the Amazon Basin (own figure).</figcaption>
</div>

## Topic 02: Animals in the wild üó∫Ô∏è Map of the Rock Monitor in South Africa

<div class="blog-image">
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/projects/RockMonitor_SouthAfrica_GernotNikolaus.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Rock Monitor South Africa">
  <figcaption>Map of the Rock Monitor in South Africa (own figure).</figcaption>
</div>

**#AnimalsInTheWild** was the second theme of our **#12WeekGeoChallenge!** The map shows the number of sightings of the Rock Monitor Lizard (*Varanus albigularis*) across South Africa in 2019 - no more information needed, just the distribution.

## Topic 03: Local Landmarks üó∫Ô∏è The Great Wall of China

<div class="blog-image">
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/projects/TheGreatWallOfChina_GernotNikolaus.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Rock Monitor South Africa">
  <figcaption>Map of the Great Wall of China (own figure).</figcaption>
</div>

Showcasing the third map for our **#12WeekGeoChallenge**, focusing on **#LocalLandmarks**. This one highlights the iconic **Great Wall of China**, capturing its incredible span across the country - while sticking to a single-color theme.

## Topic 04: Minimalist Map üó∫Ô∏è Mountain Peaks Prominence & Shinkansen Train Line of Japan

For the latest topic of our #12WeekGeoChallenge, focusing on #MinimalistMaps, I created two maps showcasing iconic aspects of Japan.

<div class="blog-image">
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/projects/Mountains_Japan_GernotNikolaus.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Japan mountains, the top ten peaks with the highest prominence">
  <figcaption>Japan mountains - the top ten peaks with the highest prominence (own figure).</figcaption>
</div>

First of all, the **Mountains of Japan**: Highlighting the top ten peaks with the highest prominence across the country, with a bold, single-color theme.

<div class="blog-image">
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/projects/Shinkansen_Japan_GernotNikolaus.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Shinkansen, the speed train line of Japan">
  <figcaption>Shinkansen, the speed train line of Japan (own figure).</figcaption>
</div>

Secondly, the **Shinkansen Speed Train Lines**: Mapping Japan‚Äôs famous high-speed rail network, keeping it simple and clean.




More details about the challenge and other maps will be added soon!
