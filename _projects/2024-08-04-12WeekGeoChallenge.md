Inspired by the **30DayMapChallenge**, friends and I created our own **12WeekGeoChallenge**, where we have one week to create a map on a specific topic. I mostly used ArcGIS Pro, as well as the Affinity suit for drawing and creating own symbols etc.

## Topic 01: river networks/water bodies üó∫Ô∏è Map of the Amazon Basin

## Topic 02: Animals in the wild üó∫Ô∏è Map of the Rock Monitor in South Africa

<div class="blog-image">

  <figcaption>Map of the Rock Monitor in South Africa (own figure).</figcaption>
</div>

**#AnimalsInTheWild** was the second theme of our **#12WeekGeoChallenge!** The map shows the number of sightings of the Rock Monitor Lizard (*Varanus albigularis*) across South Africa in 2019 - no more information needed, just the distribution.

## Topic 03: Local Landmarks üó∫Ô∏è The Great Wall of China

</div>

Showcasing the third map for our **#12WeekGeoChallenge**, focusing on **#LocalLandmarks**. This one highlights the iconic **Great Wall of China**, capturing its incredible span across the country - while sticking to a single-color theme.

## Topic 04: Minimalist Map üó∫Ô∏è Mountain Peaks Prominence & Shinkansen Train Line of Japan

For the latest topic of our #12WeekGeoChallenge, focusing on #MinimalistMaps, I created two maps showcasing iconic aspects of Japan.

<div class="blog-image">
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/projects/Mountains_Japan_GernotNikolaus.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Japan mountains, the top ten peaks with the highest prominence">
  <figcaption>Japan mountains - the top ten peaks with the highest prominence (own figure).</figcaption>
</div>

First of all, the **Mountains of Japan**: Highlighting the top ten peaks with the highest prominence across the country, with a bold, single-color theme.

<div class="blog-image">
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/projects/Shinkansen_Japan_GernotNikolaus.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Shinkansen, the speed train line of Japan">
  <figcaption>Shinkansen, the speed train line of Japan (own figure).</figcaption>
</div>

Secondly, the **Shinkansen Speed Train Lines**: Mapping Japan‚Äôs famous high-speed rail network, keeping it simple and clean.

## Topic 05: Creative Lines üó∫Ô∏è Cyclone Activity in Northern Queensland, Australia (2000-2020)

<div class="blog-image">
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/projects/Cyclones_NorthernQueenslandAustralia_GernotNikolaus.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Cyclones Northern Queensland Australia">
  <figcaption>Map of Cyclone Activity in Northern Queensland, Australia (2000-2020).</figcaption>
</div>

Showcasing the fifth map for our #12WeekGeoChallenge, this time focusing on #CreativeLines! This visualization captures cyclone activity along the northern Queensland coast from Port Douglas to Mackay over two decades. I know some areas are quite data-dense, but I wanted to take on the challenge of representing three different attributes within a single line symbol: nature (type of storm), season, and year.

Balancing multiple variables while maintaining clarity was an exciting cartographic experiment. I hope this map conveys both the frequency and complexity of these storm systems in the region.

## Topic 06: Travel/Adventure Route üó∫Ô∏è Magellan's Circumnavigation | 1519-1522

<div class="blog-image">
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/projects/MagellanExpedition_GernotNikolaus.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Magellan's Circumnavigation | 1519-1522">
  <figcaption>Topic 06: Travel/Adventure Route üó∫Ô∏è Magellan's Circumnavigation | 1519-1522 (own figure).</figcaption>
</div>

Presenting the sixth map for the #12WeekGeoChallenge, themed around #TravelRoute! This map traces the historic journey of Ferdinand Magellan and Juan Sebasti√°n Elcano, known as the first successful circumnavigation of the globe. The route covers key stops from Spain, across the Atlantic, around the Strait of Magellan, across the Pacific, and back via the Indian Ocean. 

For this map, I chose to experiment with a polar coordinate system to center the entire journey. 



More details about the challenge and other maps will be added soon!
