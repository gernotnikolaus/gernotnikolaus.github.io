Inspired by the **30DayMapChallenge**, friends and I created our own **12WeekGeoChallenge**, where we have one week to create a map on a specific topic. I mostly used ArcGIS Pro, as well as the Affinity suit for drawing and creating own symbols etc.
Topics of the challenge:
<!---
* River Networks/Waterbodies
* Animals in the wild
* Local Landmarks
* Minimalist Map
* Creative Lines
* Travel/Adventure Route
* Polar Regions
* Elevation Map
* Natural Disasters/Human Impact
* Unexpected Map
* Air Quality
* Raster Creativity -->
