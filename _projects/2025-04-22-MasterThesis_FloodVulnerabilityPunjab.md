### Introduction
Flooding is one of the greatest dangers globally, which not only destroys infrastructure and damages the economy, but also claims human lives (Bates et al., 2008; Kundzewicz et al., 2014; Rentschler, Salhab and Jafino, 2022; Chen et al., 2024). Pakistan, especially the Punjab region, is affected frequently by floods, due to its high population density, agricultural activities, and the presence of five major rivers (Rahman et al., 2017; Waseem and Rana, 2023; Chen et al., 2024). Yearly flood events are exacerbated by climate change (Aldous et al., 2011; Arnell and Gosling, 2013; Kundzewicz et al., 2014; Youssef et al., 2021) thus demanding for effective flood assessments and effective mitigation strategies.
To address flooding globally, researchers have turned to flooding models in combining remote sensing data, Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques, and various flood drivers, to assess the flood challenge in a study area (Gigović et al., 2017; Hoque et al., 2019; Burayu, Karuppannan and Shuniye, 2023; Hossain and Mumu, 2024; Ibrahim et al., 2024; Roy and Dhar, 2024; Ullah et al., 2024). While remote sensing provides important data about topographic conditions, the GIS environment gives the opportunity to store and process this data. Depending on the study and the area, different parameters are chosen and their influence on the study’s model is determined.
The flood danger and the large number of people affected in the Punjab province was the motivation for this study. Although global research on flooding exists, only a few studies concentrate on Pakistan, and fewer on the highly affected Punjab region. Studies in Punjab mainly focus on the assessment of areas that are prone to floods and where flooding occurs, but the population is not taken into account. As flood events not only affect the landscape, but also communities, it is important to investigate flooding from a multi-dimensional perspective. Such a perspective is used in this master's thesis by developing a flood vulnerability framework. This framework consists of three components which are used to highlight areas most vulnerable to flooding. While one component considers physical and environmental factors, the others reflect the affected population. Another motivation lies in the mapping of the results. Recognizing that good visualizations, which effectively communicate the results, are missing in existing flood research, this study also focuses on creating visually appealing maps. Different mapping techniques are developed and evaluated in user testing to come to a visualization which works for different users.
All results are compiled into a printed atlas, making the outcomes tangible and accessible not only for informing a decision but also for the general or local population.

### Objectives
The aims of the master’s thesis is to analyze the flood vulnerability in Punjab, Pakistan by developing a flood vulnerability assessment by integrating environmental, social, and coping capacity indicators, and using Copernicus satellite- and geospatial data and tools. The main focus of the thesis lies in the identification of the flood-prone and the most vulnerable areas. The study aims to enhance flood risk mapping and visualization to support decision-making and disaster risk management. To achieve this, a review is done on floods, risk, and relevant vulnerability indicators.
The results of the thesis will be presented through spatial overlay analyses and a cartographic product. In spatial analysis, the focus lies on identifying the flood-prone areas and determining the main factors of vulnerability. Through user testing, the usability of the different cartographic visualization techniques is evaluated to improve the communication of flood risk information. The final output of the thesis will be a printed Atlas, featuring maps of hazard and vulnerability areas, demographic impacts of floods, infographics, and textual commentary. A story map will serve as a digital supplement to the printed atlas, embedded with an electronic version of the printed atlas.
The objectives of this master’s thesis can be structured and divided as follows:
I. Geospatial Analysis and Mapping of Flood Vulnerability
    1. Mapping of vulnerability indicators.
    2. Analytical Hierarchy Process.
    3. Determine flood-prone and vulnerable areas based on geospatial analysis.
    4. Validate the flood-prone areas with Sentinel-1 SAR data.
II. Cartographic Design and User Testing
    1. Create visual approaches of flood vulnerability.
    2. Conduct user testing to evaluate the effectiveness of the mapping results.
III. Cartographic Project of the Atlas
    1. Compile an atlas that conveys the results effectively.
    2. Create a digital product.

### Study Area
The study area – Punjab, Pakistan – is one of the five provinces of Pakistan (Figure 1). According to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistic (PBS), almost 130 million people live in the region. Although it is not the largest region, it is the most populated one in Pakistan (PBS, 2023). The region spans an area of 205,345 km² and borders India on the eastern side. The PBS divides the province in their census into 36 districts, as well as 146 Tehsils; these are the administrative regions below the district level. The presence of the five major rivers – Indus, Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi as well as Sutlej – has made Punjab an agricultural center of the country, but prone to catastrophic flooding (Rahman et al., 2017).

Flood risk and vulnerability are a central concern in the province. According to Rentschler et al. (2022), Pakistan is among the top ten countries where the population is exposed to high flood risk. In particular, the Punjab region is in third place among the subnational administrative areas with the highest absolute number exposed to floods: 38% of the population lives in high-risk flood zones. 2022 was the severest flood since the 2010 flooding (Waseem and Rana, 2023), affecting 33 million people (WFP, 2024). Almost every three years Pakistan is hit by flood events; between 1950 and 2021 around 21 extreme flood events occurred in the country (Waseem and Rana, 2023). The monsoon season is from June to September and brings severe rainfall (Latif and He, 2025). In the last three years, the average monsoon rainfall was above average (PMD, 2024). This is also reflected in the flood severity, the last year’s floods, in 2024, caused 94 lives in Punjab, among them 46 children, while 238 got injured, including 86 children (Islamic Relief, 2024).

### Methodology
The workflow of this study followed a structured approach, integrating literature review, expert consulting, spatial data analysis, and user testing to develop and visualize a flood vulnerability assessment (Figure 2). Based on literature review, freely available data, and meetings with experts in disaster risk, climatology, and meteorology, 13 parameters were defined for this study. These indicators were derived from various data sources. Each parameter was mapped, classified and ranked into classes, ranging from 1, very low, to 5, very high (Hoque et al., 2019; Allafta and Opp, 2021; Ullah et al., 2024).

The component maps were generated by a weighted overlay analysis based on multi-criteria decision analysis, using Analytical Hierarchy Process and applying normalized weights to the indicators. The importance of each parameter was derived using a survey. Similar to other studies (Hoque et al., 2019; Allafta and Opp, 2021; Roy and Dhar, 2024; Ullah et al., 2024), a pairwise comparison matrix was created, relative scores were calculated, and the consistency of the matrix was determined.
After each map was generated, the flood vulnerability was assessed with different approaches, including formula-based results, as well as different cartographic ways. As the study region is very large, it is important to still be able to show regions that have a high vulnerability and to make this message not only available to researchers but also understandable to people. Therefore, the creation of accessible and legible information is important. To achieve that, data has to be generalized to present it in a way that shows high vulnerability areas in a static format. The vulnerability cartographic mapping approach was rated and evaluated with two user groups: the general public and climate risk analyzers, identifying which mapping techniques are preferred.
The analysis, the parameter maps, the cartographic maps, as well as the results of the analysis were compiled into an atlas. Furthermore, a digital product was created.

#### Datasets and Sources
Different datasets were used for the different parameters used in this study (Table 1). PERSIANN-CSS (Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks - Cloud Classification System) data was used for the Annual Rainfall, downloaded via the CHRS data portal (CHRS, no date). Drainage Density, Elevation, Slope, and Topographic Wetness Index were obtained from the FABDEM (Forest And Buildings removed Copernicus 30m DEM). FABDEM is a product from the Copernicus GLO 30 Digital Elevation Model (DEM), delivering a resolution of 1 arc-second grid spacing (approximately 30m at the equator), whereas errors of buildings and vegetation were removed (Hawker et al., 2022). The WorldCover V2 2021 was used for the Land Use Land Cover (Zanaga et al., 2022). Health facilities were downloaded provided by the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team via the Humanitarian Data Exchange portal; the same applies to the river stream data. The census data of 2023 was accessed at the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics website (PBS, 2023), and downloaded as PDFs. Sentinel-1 SAR data was used for validating part of the model (Copernicus Sentinel data, 2021-2024), and retrieved via Google Earth Engine (https://earthengine.google.com/).
