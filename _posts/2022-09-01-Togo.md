I worked on the first phase of a two-year project to combat three neglected tropical diseases - Leprosy, Buruli ulcer and Yaws - in Togo. In August and September 2022, I was in the DAHW Togo office in Lom√© for two months. I travelled around the country, visited hospitals and villages, and together with the Ministry of Health, recorded the situation and the data of the patients. I also conducted GIS training for the local staff of the Ministry of Health so that the project could continue to run sustainably on the ground.

After my time in Togo, I continued to work on the project and remotely created more maps of disease distribution. In addition, I was available for further questions and work steps. Furthermore, I studied Buruli ulcer and Yaws for spatial correlations and conducted analyses to examine the distribution of these diseases in Togo.
