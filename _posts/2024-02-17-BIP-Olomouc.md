I had the chance to take part in the Blended Intensive Program (BIP) Digital Earth Citizens in Olomouc, at the Palack√Ω University in Olomouc in cooperation with Z_GIS - Department of Geoinformatics, University of Salzburg and I am happy to share some insights from the event.

The program started online in November 2023 and concluded in a physical week in February 2024 which included discussions and presentations, workshops, and hands-on lectures, all aimed at exploring various facets of our field. Different topics such as detailed explorations of the ArcGIS platform, (geo)-visualization techniques, user experience design, and Public Participation Geographic Information System (PPGIS) were covered. There were morning and afternoon sessions, each filled with insightful content and practical learning opportunities. Undoubtedly, one of the highlights of this experience was the opportunity to connect with people from various countries and cultures. This networking aspect was invaluable, as it facilitated an exchange of great ideas. Not only could I connect with fellow students but I also had the opportunity to meet with lecturers and seniors, exchanging information about future academic paths and my master's thesis.
Additionally, I had the chance to explore Olomouc, where I will spend my second academic year pursuing my EM CDE Master's degree with the specialization track in GeoVisualisation and Geocommunication. I was captivated by the small yet beautiful city's rich history and lively atmosphere. Having already immensely enjoyed my time there, I am looking forward to studying in Olomouc in half a year.

I extend a huge thank you to the organizers for putting together such a fantastic event, and to all the people I met for making it an unforgettable experience!
