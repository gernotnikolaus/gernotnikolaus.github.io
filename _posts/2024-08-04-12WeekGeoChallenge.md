Inspired by the **30DayMapChallenge**, friends and I created our own **12WeekGeoChallenge**, where we have one week to create a map on a specific topic.

## Topic 01: river networks/water bodies 🗺️ Map of the Amazon Basin

<div class="blog-image">
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/blogs/AmazonBasin_GernotNikolaus.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Amazon Basin Map">

## Topic 02: Animal in the wild 🗺️

More details about the challenge and other maps will be added soon!
