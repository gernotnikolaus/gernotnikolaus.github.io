 In September and October, I had the amazing opportunity to work with the RSPB and live on Rathlin Island (Northern Ireland) as part of the LIFE Raft Project. This large-scale seabird conservation initiative aims to protect species such as Puffins, Guillemots, and Razorbills by managing invasive species and restoring the island’s ecosystem. Across the island, over 6,500 bait stations are monitored and managed through GIS. I worked in remote areas and rough weather conditions to collect field data, check and maintain stations, and identify remaining predators. Besides that, I strengthened my bird and plant ID skills and gained hands-on experience in practical conservation supported by geospatial technology.
