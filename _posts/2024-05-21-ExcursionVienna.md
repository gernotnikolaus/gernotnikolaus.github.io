End of May, I was on an excursion in Vienna, visiting two key institutions as part of the EM CDE Copernicus Hubs and Institutions course: the Earth Observation Data Centre for Water Resources Monitoring EODC and the Federal Office of Metrology and Surveying (BEV).

At the EODC, we discussed the infrastructure for Copernicus data management as well as visited the storage facilities and the Vienna Scientific Clusters. It was particularly exciting for me to see how efficiently the huge amounts of data are stored.
Later at the BEV, we gained insights into the importance of accurate geospatial information for various sectors, from land management to government planning.

This excursion underlined the importance of data management, processing, and application in both the public and private sectors. Correct geospatial information is the basis for government functions, policy decisions, and research. Thanks again to Christian Briese and Benjamin Schumacher as well as Markus Jobst for the enriching experience that provided insights into Copernicus data implementation from different perspectives of national institutions in Austria.
