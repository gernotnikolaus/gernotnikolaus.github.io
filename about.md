    <div class="about-text">
        <p>I am Gernot Nikolaus and I currently hold a Bachelor's degree in Geovisualization from the Technical University of Applied Sciences Würzburg-Schweinfurt, Germany. My coursework covered both theoretical and practical aspects of the field of geospatial data, geoinformation, and visualization. Spending two months in Togo for my bachelor’s thesis gave me the opportunity to apply this gained knowledge in the context of humanitarian aid. During this time, I worked with the German Leprosy and Tuberculosis Relief Association (DAHW). DAHW is running a project in Togo funded by the German government to combat leprosy, buruli ulcer and yaws. I travelled around the country, visiting hospitals and villages and working with the Ministry of Health to assess the situation and record patient data. I also gave GIS training to local Ministry of Health staff to ensure the sustainability of the project. With the data collected, I created hotspot maps of the three diseases to provide spatial information on their distribution and to plan prevention campaigns. To deepen my knowledge on earth observation and remote sensing, I am currently studying the Copernicus Master in Digital Earth at the University of Salzburg, Austria.</p>
