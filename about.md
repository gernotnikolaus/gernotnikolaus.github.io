<div class="about-container">
    <div class="about-text">
        <p>I am interested in geospatial data, earth observation, and humanitarian work. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Geovisualization from the Technical University of Applied Sciences Würzburg-Schweinfurt, where I developed expertise in geoinformation and visualization techniques. I gained practical experience applying GIS technology to health-related challenges, particularly during a project in Togo with the German Leprosy and Tuberculosis Relief Association (DAHW). In this role, I mapped the distribution of diseases such as leprosy, Buruli ulcer, and yaws, supporting health initiatives in collaboration with the Ministry of Health.
        
        Currently, I am pursuing a double master’s degree in the Copernicus Master in Digital Earth program, a joint initiative between the University of Salzburg and Palacký University Olomouc. My research interests focus on remote sensing, disaster risk assessment, and climate change. After interning with the United Nations University - Institute for Environment and Human Security (UNU-EHS), where I contributed to disaster modeling, I am now working as a GIS Consultant at UNU-EHS, contributing to climate risk insurance projects.</p>
