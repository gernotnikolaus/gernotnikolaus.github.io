    <div class="about-text">
        <p>My name is Gernot Nikolaus and I hold a Bachelor's degree in Geovisualization - the coursework covered both theoretical and practical aspects of geospatial data, geoinformation, and visualization. During my bachelor's thesis, I spent two months in Togo, where I had the opportunity to apply my knowledge in the context of humanitarian aid. During this time, I collaborated with the German Leprosy and Tuberculosis Relief Association (DAHW) on a project in Togo funded by the German government to combat leprosy, buruli ulcer, and yaws. My responsibilities included traveling around the country to visit hospitals and villages, working with the Ministry of Health to assess the situation and record patient data, and providing GIS training to local Ministry of Health staff to ensure the project's sustainability. Using the collected data, I created hotspot maps for the three diseases to provide spatial information on their distribution and plan prevention campaigns. Currently, I am pursuing a double master's degree in Copernicus Master in Digital Earth at the University of Salzburg, Austria, and Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic to deepen my knowledge of earth observation and remote sensing as well as visualization.</p>
